# Tic-Tac-Toe
2 verions of a Tic Tac Toe Game.

The first one has 3 levels of decision-making algorithm for AI vs player option along with the PvP option but it requires keyboard input.

The applet is designed to use buttons for better UI (i.e. display turns, turn buttons into X or O, show who's turn it is and who wins) 
while having the AI just use random assignment.

Note: Was programmed using older verion of Java and IDE called "Ready to Program Java IDE"
